🚀 RAG Lab: From Search to Answers
Transform Your Semantic Search into an AI Q&A System
Welcome to the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Lab! You've mastered semantic search in the Vector Databases Lab - now it's time to add AI generation to create a complete question-answering system.

🎯 Lab Objective
Your Mission: Build a production-ready RAG system that doesn't just find relevant documents, but generates accurate, context-aware answers from them.

The Challenge: Your CEO wants the system to answer "Yes, you can work 3 days from home" instead of just showing the remote work policy document.

📚 Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have completed:

✅ Vector Databases Lab - Understanding embeddings, ChromaDB, and semantic search
✅ Familiarity with Python and basic NLP concepts
✅ Understanding of vector similarity and document chunking
🏗️ What You'll Build
A complete RAG pipeline that:

Retrieves relevant document chunks using semantic search (95% accuracy)
Augments prompts with retrieved context
Generates accurate answers using LLM (openai/gpt-4.1-mini)
Cites sources for transparency

Why RAG?
Accuracy: Answers based on actual documents, not general knowledge
Transparency: Source citations for every answer
Control: Responses limited to your document collection
Scalability: Add new documents without retraining
🚦 Getting Started
1. Environment Setup
# Activate virtual environment
source /root/venv/bin/activate

# Verify environment
python3 /root/code/verify_environment.py
2. Required Packages
chromadb - Vector database
sentence-transformers - Embeddings
langchain - RAG framework
langchain-openai - LLM integration
numpy - Vector operations
3. Environment Variables
export OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:8080/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="dummy-key-for-proxy"
📂 Document Collection
Your TechCorp documents are in /root/techcorp-docs/:

policies/ - Company policies and guidelines
products/ - Product specifications
support/ - Support documentation
🏃 Running the Lab
Execute tasks in order:

# Task 1: Setup
python3 /root/code/task_1_setup_vectorstore.py

# Task 2: Process Documents
python3 /root/code/task_2_document_processing.py

# Task 3: Configure LLM
python3 /root/code/task_3_llm_integration.py

# Task 4: Design Prompts
python3 /root/code/task_4_prompt_engineering.py

# Task 5: Complete Pipeline
python3 /root/code/task_5_complete_rag.py
✅ Success Criteria
Each task creates a marker file in /root/markers/:

task1_setup_complete.txt
task2_processing_complete.txt
task3_llm_complete.txt
task4_prompt_complete.txt
task5_rag_complete.txt
🎯 Expected Outcomes
By completing this lab, you'll have:

Working RAG System - Complete Q&A pipeline
95% Accuracy - Semantic search finding the right documents
Context-Aware Answers - LLM generating from retrieved content
Source Attribution - Every answer cites its sources
Production-Ready Code - Scalable, maintainable architecture
💡 Tips for Success
Read the TODOs carefully - Each has a clear hint
Check line numbers - They guide you to the exact location
Test incrementally - Run each task before moving on
Review output - Understand what each component does
Use the hints - They show exactly what to fill in
🆘 Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Import Error: Run pip install commands from environment setup
API Error: Check OPENAI_API_BASE and OPENAI_API_KEY are set
No documents found: Run Task 2 to process documents first
Empty collection: Ensure Task 1 completed successfully
